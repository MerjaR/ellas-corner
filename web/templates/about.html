        <h1>About Ella’s Corner</h1>
        <p class="about-tagline"><strong>For your baby, from our families.</strong></p>
    </div>


        <p>
            Ella’s Corner was created with one mission: to support new parents through one of life’s most joyful and overwhelming transitions.
            Inspired by the Finnish baby box — a tradition of care, preparedness, and community — we wanted to offer something just as meaningful to every family, no matter where they are in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Ella’s Corner, we believe that those who are a little further along the path have wisdom worth sharing.
            That’s why every recommendation, every tip, and every product in our curated lists is community-tested and
            loved (and we also show you the items that are sometimes not loved!) by real parents navigating real life with little ones.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a place where your journey is seen, your questions are welcome, and your experience is valued.
            Whether you’re expecting your first baby or adjusting to sleepless nights, Ella’s Corner is here to make things just a little easier 
            with warmth, simplicity, and the kind of honesty only fellow parents can give.
        </p>

        <h2>From Our Community</h2>

        <blockquote>
            “The baby box gave me peace of mind during the chaos of becoming a first-time mom.
            Knowing each item was recommended by other parents made it feel like I had a village behind me.”<br>

        <blockquote>
            “I posted about struggling with bath time, and within hours, I had practical tips and product suggestions that actually worked.
            It’s like a parenting group that gets it.”<br>

        <blockquote>
            “We live far from family, so Ella’s Corner became that reassuring voice we were missing.
            It’s not just a site — it’s comfort.”<br>
